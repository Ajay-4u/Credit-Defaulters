# Credit-Defaulters
A project that requires an analysis on the credit card payments of customers.

It is no surprise that Credit Card Default has been a field of interest to many banks and agencies for decades. Whether they offer a secured loan or an unsecured loan, they are interested in knowing who is likely to default on the next payment so they do not have to cover the loss of these defaulters. 

This project analyzes the transactional data of Credit loan users to study the characteristics of the customers, eventually building a profile of customers most likely to default on their next payment using techniques such as univariate and bivariate analysis. 

With this analysis, we will be able to understand the factors or characteristics of a customer who is likely to default, with the profile acting as a criterion for the bank or lending facility to detect potential defaulters and take appropriate actions in a timely manner.
